# myfood24-digibete

A myfood24 integration with digibete

<!-- ## Installation

```sh
npm install myfood24-digibete
``` -->

## Usage

```js
import { test } from 'myfood24-digibete';

// ...

<Button title="Click Me" onPress={()=>{test()}} />
```

Currently the test function will provide you with a basic popup that will contain the integration.

If you are having any issues you can refer to the example folder as it contains a working connection of both the iOS and Android integrations.

To setup the example folder run the following in the root of the project (where this file is located)
```bash
yarn
yarn example ios
```
